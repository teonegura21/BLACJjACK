# Automatic Count Reset System

**Intelligent shuffle detection that resets the count automatically**

No more manually tracking when the dealer shuffles - the system detects it for you and resets the count automatically.

---

## Overview

The automatic reset system uses **multiple detection methods** to identify when a new shoe is being used. When detected, the system automatically:

✅ Resets the running count to 0
✅ Clears the true count
✅ Resets card inventory tracking
✅ Plays audio alert (2 long beeps)
✅ Logs the reason for reset

---

## Detection Methods

### 1. **Penetration Limit** (Most Common)

**Trigger**: 75% or more of the shoe has been dealt

```
Default: 75% penetration
In 6-deck shoe: 234 cards dealt (out of 312)
```

**Why**: Casinos typically shuffle when 70-80% of cards are dealt (cut card placement). System automatically resets when this threshold is reached.

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "counting": {
    "penetration": 0.75  // 75% limit
  }
}
```

**Example**:
```
Cards dealt: 240 / 312 (76.9%)
AUTO-RESET TRIGGERED: Penetration Limit Reached
Count reset to 0
```

---

### 2. **Card Depletion** (Impossible Count Detection)

**Trigger**: More cards seen than physically possible

```
Example: 5x Ace of Hearts detected (impossible - max is 4 in 6-deck)
Example: 320 total cards seen (impossible - max is 312 in 6-deck)
```

**Why**: If the system detects an impossible card count, it means either:
- Detection error occurred
- New shoe started mid-count
- System tracking got out of sync

The safest action is to reset the count.

**Example**:
```
Detected: 7th occurrence of 10♠ (impossible in 6-deck)
AUTO-RESET TRIGGERED: Card Depletion (impossible count)
Count reset to 0
```

---

### 3. **Long Pause** (Inactivity Detection)

**Trigger**: No cards detected for 30+ seconds

```
Default: 30 seconds
Configurable: 15-60 seconds
```

**Why**: A long pause typically indicates:
- Dealer is shuffling
- Break between shoes
- End of session

**Configuration**:
```cpp
shuffleDetector->setInactivityThreshold(30); // seconds
```

**Example**:
```
Last card detected: 35 seconds ago
AUTO-RESET TRIGGERED: Long Pause (30+ seconds)
Count reset to 0
```

---

### 4. **All Cards Disappeared**

**Trigger**: All visible cards vanish for 2+ seconds (60+ consecutive empty frames)

```
Was detecting cards → Suddenly all gone for 2 seconds
```

**Why**: When dealer picks up all cards to shuffle, they temporarily disappear from view. System detects this as shuffle in progress.

**Example**:
```
Cards detected: 5, 7, 3, 2, ...
Empty frames: 62 consecutive (2+ seconds)
AUTO-RESET TRIGGERED: All Cards Disappeared
Count reset to 0
```

---

## How It Works

### Detection Flow

```
Every Frame:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Detect cards with YOLOv11X  │
└───────────┬─────────────────────┘
            │
            ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 2. Update shuffle detector      │
│    - Track card inventory       │
│    - Monitor penetration        │
│    - Check for inactivity       │
│    - Detect card disappearance  │
└───────────┬─────────────────────┘
            │
            ▼
     ┌──────────────┐
     │ Shuffle?     │
     │ detected?    │
     └──┬───────┬───┘
        │ No    │ Yes
        │       │
        │       ▼
        │ ┌─────────────────────────┐
        │ │ AUTO-RESET:             │
        │ │ - Reset count to 0      │
        │ │ - Reset inventory       │
        │ │ - Play audio alert      │
        │ │ - Log reason            │
        │ └─────────────────────────┘
        │
        ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 3. Continue counting            │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Card Inventory Tracking

The system tracks every individual card seen:

```cpp
Card Inventory (6-deck shoe):
┌───────────────┬───────┬─────────┐
│ Card          │ Seen  │ Max     │
├───────────────┼───────┼─────────┤
│ Ace Hearts    │ 4     │ 6  ✓    │
│ 2 Diamonds    │ 5     │ 6  ✓    │
│ 7 Spades      │ 3     │ 6  ✓    │
│ King Clubs    │ 7     │ 6  ✗    │ ← IMPOSSIBLE!
└───────────────┴───────┴─────────┘

Detection: 7th King of Clubs → AUTO-RESET
```

## Configuration Options

### Penetration Limit

```json
{
  "counting": {
    "deck_count": 6,
    "penetration": 0.75  // Reset at 75%
  }
}
```

**Recommendations**:
- **0.70**: Conservative (resets earlier)
- **0.75**: Standard (matches typical casino cut card)
- **0.80**: Aggressive (maximizes high-count opportunities)

### Inactivity Threshold

```cpp
// In code initialization:
shuffleDetector->setInactivityThreshold(30); // seconds
```

**Recommendations**:
- **20s**: Fast-paced online blackjack
- **30s**: Standard casino pace (default)
- **45s**: Slow casino or multi-player tables

### Minimum Cards for Reset

```cpp
// Require at least 26 cards (half deck) before allowing auto-reset
shuffleDetector->setMinCardsForReset(26);
```

**Why**: Prevents false resets at the start of a session when system is just starting to detect cards.

## Audio Alerts

### Auto-Reset Alert
```
♫♫ (2 long beeps, 600ms each)
```

**Meaning**: Count has been automatically reset (new shoe detected)

### Manual Reset Alert
```
♫ (1 long beep, 800ms)
```

**Meaning**: You manually pressed 'R' to reset count

---

## Manual Override

You can still manually reset if needed:

**Press 'R'** to force a count reset

**When to use**:
- System missed a shuffle
- Starting mid-shoe (you want fresh count)
- System behavior seems incorrect

---

## Status Display

Press 'S' to see current status:

```
--- STATUS ---
Running Count: +8
True Count: +2.1
Penetration: 45.2%
Recommended Bet: $80
--------------
```

**Penetration**: Shows how much of the shoe has been dealt
- 0-50%: Early in shoe
- 50-75%: Mid-shoe
- 75%+: Near shuffle (auto-reset imminent)

---

## Advantages

### 1. **No Manual Tracking**
- Don't need to watch when dealer shuffles
- System handles it automatically
- One less thing to think about

### 2. **Never Miss a Shuffle**
- Multiple detection methods
- Redundant safeguards
- Catches shuffles even if you're distracted

### 3. **Prevents Count Errors**
- Impossible card detection prevents tracking errors
- Auto-recovery from detection glitches
- Maintains count accuracy

### 4. **Optimal Timing**
- Resets at penetration limit (when count becomes less reliable)
- Matches casino shuffle patterns
- Maximizes high-count betting opportunities

---

## Detection Accuracy

### Success Rates (Expected)

| Method | Detection Rate | False Positive Rate |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| Penetration Limit | 100% | 0% |
| Card Depletion | >95% | <1% |
| Long Pause | >90% | <5% |
| Cards Disappeared | >85% | <10% |

**Overall**: >99% of shuffles detected automatically

---

## Troubleshooting

### False Resets (Too Frequent)

**Problem**: System resets count when no shuffle occurred

**Solutions**:
1. Increase penetration limit to 0.80-0.85
2. Increase inactivity threshold to 45-60 seconds
3. Check for detection errors (poor lighting, card visibility)

### Missed Shuffles (Count Doesn't Reset)

**Problem**: Dealer shuffles but system doesn't reset

**Solutions**:
1. Decrease penetration limit to 0.70
2. Manually press 'R' when shuffle occurs
3. Check if cards are being detected (view logs)

### Resets Too Early

**Problem**: Count resets before full shoe is dealt

**Solutions**:
1. Increase penetration limit (e.g., 0.80 or 0.85)
2. Verify `deck_count` in config matches actual shoe (6 or 8 decks)

### Resets During Play

**Problem**: Count resets in middle of active play

**Solutions**:
1. Likely card depletion detected (impossible count)
2. Check detection accuracy (may be detecting same card multiple times)
3. Increase `confidence_threshold` to reduce false detections

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Disable Specific Detection Methods

```cpp
// In shuffle_detector.cpp, comment out unwanted checks:

void ShuffleDetector::update(...) {
    // checkCardDepletion();     // Disable card depletion
    checkPenetration();           // Keep penetration
    // checkInactivity();         // Disable inactivity
    // checkCardDisappearance();  // Disable disappearance
}
```

### Custom Penetration Per Shoe Type

```cpp
// 6-deck shoe: 75% penetration
if (deckCount == 6) {
    shuffleDetector->setPenetrationLimit(0.75);
}

// 8-deck shoe: 70% penetration (deeper shuffle)
if (deckCount == 8) {
    shuffleDetector->setPenetrationLimit(0.70);
}
```

---

## Logging

The system logs all auto-reset events:

```
========================================
AUTO-RESET TRIGGERED: Penetration Limit Reached
Cards seen: 240
Penetration: 76.9%
Count automatically reset to 0
========================================
```

**Log location**: `logs/blackjack_advisor.log`

**What's logged**:
- Reset trigger reason
- Current penetration
- Cards seen
- Timestamp

---

## Expected Behavior

### Typical Session

```
[Start]
Cards detected, counting begins...
RC: +2, TC: +0.5, Penetration: 15%

[Mid-shoe]
RC: +12, TC: +3.0, Penetration: 52%
>> High count - bet big!

[Approaching shuffle]
RC: +8, TC: +2.5, Penetration: 74%

[Auto-reset]
Penetration: 76% → AUTO-RESET TRIGGERED
♫♫ (2 long beeps)
RC: 0, TC: 0.0, Penetration: 0%

[New shoe]
Cards detected, counting begins again...
RC: -1, TC: -0.3, Penetration: 8%
```
